# Master's Thesis - Ellipsoid Method in MATLAB #

This is a proof-of-concept of the ellipsoid method implemented in MATLAB. It
was developed for my master's thesis at Technische Universität München in 2014.
The repository consists of three files: The ellipsoid_method function, a helper function named
separation_oracle_omniscient, and a file with several examples. Please refer to the
inline comments regarding the parameters of the method. In addition, the MATLAB publishing files
are appended in the html folder.

## Requirements ##

The method itself has not requirements but for the visualization and plotting
features of the method, the following external functions need to be downloaded:

 * Ellipse_plot by Nima Moshtagh http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/13844-plot-an-ellipse-in-center-form/content/Ellipse_plot.m
 * CON2VERT by Michael Kleder http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/7894-con2vert-constraints-to-vertices/content/con2vert.m
